{"name":"Spectraviewer","tagline":"A cross-platform viewer utilizing the QT SDK and pyqtgraph to visualize mass spectrometry peaklist files.  Also supported are opening of results from search engines from X!Tandem, Mascot, and Proteome Discoverer as well as raw spectra files.  The impetus for this project was a way to view mass spec data on linux since a majority of viewers were lacking.","body":"SpectraViewer\r\n=============\r\n\r\nA cross-platform viewer to open up mass spec peaklist files.\r\n\r\nTo use, simply drag and drop a file onto the program.  Multiple tabs are provided to allow for any number of files to be open concurrently.\r\nDragging multiple files into a window will open all them at once for a combined view.\r\nHolding Control+dropping a file will append it to the current view (this way, you can even mix & match file types).\r\n\r\nThe current goal is functionality -- elegance can come later.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nYou need the following installed:\r\n\r\nPyQt4 -- http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt4/\r\n\r\npyqtgraph -- http://www.pyqtgraph.org/\r\n\r\nThe rest can be done with:\r\npip install -r requirements.txt\r\n\r\nSupported:\r\nmgf files - on first load the mgf file will be indexed for random access.  This is a one\r\n\ttime cost, but it is worth it.\r\n\r\nX!Tandem xml files\r\n\r\nProteome Discovered .msf files - These load very fast, anyone used to PD's abysmal (and unthreaded) speed will appreciate this\r\n\r\nMZML/PepXML\r\n\r\nMascot DAT Files","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
